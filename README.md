# SemesterProject-POS
A point of sales system
	My semester project idea is to create a Point of Sales system with a GUI that can be used like any register found at a retail store. 
	It will be able to read from a database the items and their prices, process transactions and print a receipt to a .txt file. 
	It will consist of a POS class that contains methods for processing a transaction, a Person interface that will store information 
	about a user and or a customer in a database, an Inventory class that reads product information from a database and returns the 
	information to the POS class, User and Customer classes that store name, employee #/ customer benefits number.

4/18 – Create a User class which will be called when a user “signs on” through the GUI to start a transaction. create the Person Interface which will be implemented by the User class and the Customer class to store data about the User/Customer's name and contact info in a data base.

4/25 – design and create a basic GUI and controller to be used by the POS class. Get the Inventory class to read from a database. Modify the POS class to make use of the User and Customer classes.

5/2 – connect controller to POS class and test GUI for functionality.

5/4 – debugging and testing.

5/9 – have project completed.
